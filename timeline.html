          <h5> The best place to start is with the dates assigned to the canon statements in the books themselves, or in some cases the movies (and in one case, the stage play). Part of the problem is Pottermore, the Harry Potter Wiki, and other secondary sources fans have been using to supplement their knowledge of when things happened aren't always reliable. They use extrapolation to pinpoint dates and some of them aren't always accurate.
<br>
There's also the enormous overhaul of Pottermore in 2015, where quite a few stories embedded in the game version of the website were struck from the ledgers without acknowledgment. (Wookiepedia underwent something similar when Disney bought Lucasfilm, but it at least preserved the old stuff under "Legends" to denote these long-assumed as "established" facts were no longer canon.)
