          <h6>REASON #1: NEW, LOVABLE CHARACTERS </h6>
          <h5> The movie is centered about Newt Scamander, a young wizard that leave the UK to explore the new world of New York. Since the whole story has been written by J.K. Rowling, you can expect to love them just as much as characters from HP. They have their own little quirky personalities!</h5>
        
          <h6>REASON  #2: J.K. ROWLING WAS HEAVILY INVOLVED</h6>
          <h5>With this movie, J.K. Rowling was actually involved in writing the screenplay - which wasn't the case before. So this movie will have a lot of charme that you know from the books, but maybe hasn't been transferred into the HP movies that well. </h5>
          
          <h6>REASON #3: GET TO KNOW MORE ABOUT THE MAGICAL WORLD</h6>
          <h5>This Storyline is set 70 years before harry potter - a good opportunity for all Potter fans to get to know their world even more, and learn more background info and details about it. </h5>
          
          <h6>REASON #4: CONNECTION TO REAL HISTORY</h6>
          <h5>J.K. Rowling has incorporated the Salem witch trials into her story. It's awesome to see how much detail she puts into her stories, and how she creates a whole new world around it.</h5>
          
          <h6>REASON #5: THE STORYLINE, OF COURSE!</h6>
          <h5>Even if you don't like Harry Potter or have never seen it - this movie is still from you. Apart from all the magical knowledge about the potter world, the storyline itself will simply fascinate you - having you at the edge of your seat or laughing during the movie!</h5>
