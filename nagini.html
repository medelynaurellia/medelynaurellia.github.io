            Claudia Kim was revealed to be playing Nagini – a human with cursed blood who has the ability to transform into a snake – in the final trailer for the upcoming Crimes Of Grindelwald. But some fans are concerned that the series – which in the past has been criticised for lacking any representation of persons of colour – has decided to try and shoe horn a woman of colour into a leading role but one which is a submissive character that is the property of villain Voldemort.

<br> <br>
‘Listen Joanne, we get it, you didn’t include enough representation when you wrote the books. But suddenly making Nagini into a Korean woman is garbage,’ wrote one fan after the news of Kim’s casting, but Rowling responded to defend the decision. ‘The Naga are snake-like mythical creatures of Indonesian mythology, hence the name “Nagini”. They are sometimes depicted as winged, sometimes as half-human, half-snake. Indonesia comprises a few hundred ethnic groups, including Javanese, Chinese and Betawi,’ she wrote, before concluding, ‘have a lovely day’ and adding the snake emoji.

But the author’s answer did not appease concerns, with one replying to suggest Rowling has ‘repeatedly [tried] to retroactively shoe horn representation into your books which did not exist in the texts, belittling the communities you’re trying to take credit for championing we’d like to know why you think this is appropriate’. Another reminded Rowling that the greater concern is a wider issue of diversity and the problem with Nagina is ‘that (1) Asians are peripheral in a white-centric world, (2) Asian women exist to mainly serve white men’s interests, and (3) Asian men don’t exist at all’.

The upcoming movie has also been criticised for the decision not to focus on the romance between Albus Dumbledore (played by Jude Law) and Gellert Grindelwald (Johnny Depp). Director David Yates confirmed that the movie will not ‘explicitly’ reference Dumbledore as gay – even though it’s been over 10 years since JK Rowling confirmed his sexuality – with Yates claiming that as fans are ‘aware’ of his sexuality, there was no need to mention it on screen.
